As you finish your thesis, you will want to prepare it for the formatting check. One useful feature is the `show frame' option. This will draw lines to show the margins, headspace, footspace, etc. You can toggle it on and off by going under uidaho.cls and uncommenting \verb|%\RequirePackage[showframe]{geometry}| and commenting out 
\verb|\RequirePackage{geometry}|. You need to be sure that nothing at all prints in the margin or \acs{cogs} will make you change it. Once you ensure this, you can submit your thesis for a formatting check. Doing this before you defend will allow you more time to address any formatting issues you are made aware of.

If you wish to make your slides in \LaTeX, there is a template called Defense.tex in this repository that uses the `beamer' class. This is convenient as it allows you to reuse code from your thesis, and any updates to things like figures will automatically be implemented in both places. Good luck on your presentation.
