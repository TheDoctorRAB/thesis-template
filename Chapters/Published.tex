\chapter{A Paper that is Also a Thesis Chapter}
\label{Chapter:Published}

If any of your chapters are also multi-authored publications, be sure to fill out the Statement of Contribution in the frontmatter. If all of your chapters are standalone, remove the Statement of Contribution by commenting out the \verb|\include{Frontmatter/Contribution}| command in Thesis.tex. If you have multiple chapters which have been published, modify the statement of contribution to reflect this. 

If your chapter has been submitted but the publishing process is not complete, you can add a `note' to the bibtex info in References.bib to state that the work is under review, under revision, in press, etc.
