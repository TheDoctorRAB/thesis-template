\chapter{Abstract}
This is a template that will help you use \LaTeX to write your thesis. The document will talk a lot about the functionality and conveniences of this template but is not a standalone tutorial. If you need to learn how to use \LaTeX, check out Dr. Trefor Bassett. He has a great playlist on YouTube to teach you the basics and much more. If you happened across this document without the template, you can find more at https://github.com/sjroot97/UI-Thesis-Dissertation.
