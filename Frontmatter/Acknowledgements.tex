   \chapter{Acknowledgements}
   Dr. Borrelli forced me to learn \LaTeX when I took his Nuclear Engineering basics class. I am glad to be free of the frustrations of Microsoft Word. When I started writing my thesis \cite{RootMS}, the official template provided by \acs{cogs} was deprecated. It now longer exists. I brought it up to what I understand is modern standards. My thesis got accepted with minimal hacky fixes. Hopefully this will help you pass your formatting check too.

     This work and my coursework was completed under a Graduate Fellowship funded by \acf{nrc}.
