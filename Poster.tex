%% Default mode is landscape, which is what we want, however dvips and
%% a0poster do not quite do the right thing, so we end up with text in
%% landscape style (wide and short) down a portrait page (narrow and
%% long). Printing this onto the a0 printer chops the right hand edge.
%% However, 'psnup' can save the day, reorienting the text so that the
%% poster prints lengthways down an a0 portrait bounding box.

%% [ADS 4-2005] latex --> dvips --> ps2pdf works just fine for me.
%%
%% To preview using xdvi:
%% 
%% $ xdvi -paper 1188x840mm -s 24 -nopostscript poster.dvi
%%
%% To convert dvi to Postscript:
%%
%% $ dvips -Ppdf -G0 -o poster.ps poster.dvi
%%
%% The dvips options are:
%% Ppdf: use the PDF printer configuration file
%% G0  : shift lower characters to higher position 
%%       (splits ligatures when using Times-Roman font)
%%
%% To convert Postscript to PDF:
%%
%% $ pstill -c -giptCQ -w 3368 -h 2378 -o poster.pdf poster.ps
%% ($ pstill -c -iptCQ -w 3225 -h 2378 -o poster.pdf poster.ps)
%%
%% Note that the pstill options are
%% c:  compression (more c's give more compression; up to four)
%% g:  take size from Postscript file
%% p:  include all fonts as partial fonts
%% i:  include all non-standard fonts
%% t:  map graphics transfer functions from PostScript to PDF. 
%% C:  use RGB color map
%% w:  width in points (1/72 inch) for 1188 mm
%% h:  height in points (1/72 inch) for 839 mm
%% Q:  take embedded fonts from PSFonts directory, not Postscript file
%% Note also that the -w and -h options need to be included else
%% some of the Postscript figures may not be displayed (particularly
%% those converted using fig2dev), even if the -g option is specified.
%% Also, the newest version of pstill (1.55.91) does not deal well with 
%% slanted Times Roman font; use italics or the older version (1.55.3).

%% The basic format of the poster is to create text boxes with the
%% various things you want to display.  You can then play around 
%% with how to lay thing out.  In the old version of this template,
%% the content was always provided with alternatives suitable for
%% printing on sheets of paper (resizing fonts, images, etc).  I
%% think that's too confusing to read.  The old layout was:
%%     \ifposter
%%          some poster commands go here
%%     \else
%%          an alternative style here in case you are printing on
%%          regular sheets of paper
%%     \fi
%% One option is to make the entire poster and then wrap it in an \ifposter
%% and then make all the slides separately.  This seems to be easier
%% if your poster is not much like a bunch of 8.5x11 sheet tacked together
%% in the first place.

\CHead{Introduction}            %% \CHead creates a centered title
\begin{itemize}
\item This file is a template for a 30x40 poster using textblocks \cite{RootMS}.
\item Each section is a textblock
\item Each textblock has its own size so you can have sections that span multiple columns or start each section at a different height \cite{MyOwnPaper}.
\end{itemize}
\end{textblock}



\begin{textblock}{10}(00,6.5)
\CHead{A Section}
Inline lists save space, useful for posters:
\begin{itemize*}
    \item The first point starts right next to the previous text
    \item The next point follows on the same line
    \item And so on...
\end{itemize*}\\
\lipsum[1]

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.8in]{ans}
\end{center}

Try to avoid big blocks of text that are used for the template. Use a lot of: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figures
    \item Tables
    \item Lists
    \item Equations
\end{itemize}
to convey your point in a more visually appealing manner. Consider whether you are presenting the poster, where you can help fill in some context, or if the poster will just be left up and you will need to convey every takeaway in what is printed out.

    \CHead{A Large Section with a Large Figure}    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=18in]{Loop.png}
    \end{center}

    This is a very large figure. I chose to put it at the top, right under the title, as it was the key aspect of my poster and I wanted attention drawn to it. You can change the sizes and arrangements of the textblocks to achieve a different look, or just slightly modify the size of the blocks to fit your content. Try to avoid having any text go too close to the edge or it could get cut off when printed.

\CHead{Pre-Filter}
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:prefilter}

\end{equation*}

Pre-filters are unity gain transfer functions that provide inertia against rapid changes. A pre-filter that reshapes the set-point after a change to an independent variable. It follows and exponential curve defined by the time constant.
\begin{itemize}
    \item 63.2\% after one time constant
    \item 86.5\% after two time constants
    \item 95.0\% after three time constants

\CHead{Dead-band}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type of piecewise function where the output is null for inputs surrounding zero ($\pm \delta$) but has some other value for inputs with greater magnitude.
    \item Common in thermostatic controls (where the furnace in a home only turns on when the temperature inside is sufficiently far from the setpoint).
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation*}
    K_C=
        \begin{cases}
            K_C & \text{if } e < -\delta \\
            0 & \text{if } -\delta < e < \delta \\
            K_C & \text{if } e > \delta 
        \end{cases}
\end{equation*}\\


    Previous work \cite{MyOwnPaper} showed that:
    \begin{itemize*}
        \item Conclusion 1; and 
        \item Conclusion 2;
    \end{itemize*}

And this is how that can be applied...

\begin{textblock}{10}(36,02.5)
\CHead{PID Controller}
The controller output ($u$) is often determined by a PID equation, which considers the instantaneous, cumulative, and predictive error. This equation has three terms:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proportional control term. The control output is manipulated in proportion to the error defined by the proportional gain constant ($K_P$).   
\item Integral control term, which considers the historical cumulative error in an effort to eliminate steady-state offset that a P-Only controller may exhibit. As the process variable settles around the set-point, the cumulative error approaches a constant value and the effect of the integral controller diminishes.
\item Derivative control term, which estimates the time rate of change of the error to dampen overshoot. This mechanism is sometimes referred to as anticipatory control. 
\end{enumerate}

Be sure to rearrange your textblocks to avoid large gaps like the one below


\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:pid}
    u(t) 
    = \underbrace{K_P e(t)}_{\text{Proportional}} 
    + \underbrace{K_I \int_0^t e(t)dt}_{\text{Integral}} 
    + \underbrace{K_D \frac{de(t)}{dt}}_{\text{Derivative}}
\end{equation*}
\end{textblock}


\begin{textblock}{10}(36,15)
\CHead{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A poster is usually used to present a work in progress or provide a glimse into a larger project
    \item You will usually have some future work associated, or some larger context that this fits into 
    \item It is a good idea to talk about some of this to help a ready think about the broader applications
    \item Be sure to update your acknowledgments as well as title/author/email/etc. \cite{RootMS}
